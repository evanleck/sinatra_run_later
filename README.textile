h2. Run Later for Sinatra

Slight modification of TODO: insert link
to clean up nicely when used through Rackup and @ctrl-c@ is sent.

h2. Usage:

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'run_later'

get '/' do
	run_later do
  	# some task that you don't want to block.
  	sleep 20
	end
		
	"Hello World"
end
</pre>
